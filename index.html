      <div class="job">
        <h3>Maintenance Engineer, General Dynamics Electric Boat </h3>
        <p class="date">3 years</p>
        <p>
          This role was all about validating the specifications for maintainability for the new COLUMBIA class of submarine. This was a multifaceted problem: I assisted in physical arrangements of the submarine layout to ensure adequate space for maintenance access and removal of large components; I also wrote documentation to provide the rigging trades with instructions on how to safely remove large or hard-to-reach submarine parts; and I researched the maintenance requirements of previous submarine classes to compile a series of system-by-system presentations to naval program management to identify facilities upgrades that would be necessary at naval submarine refit facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          While in this role I learned about the practical realities of designing and managing very large engineering projects. "Conway's Law," which says that the structure of a large engineering project mirrors the information flow in the company, was constantly proven to me, whose work spanned every system and component in the boat. Because of my department's unique role as bridging EB's information silos, I was constantly helping put engineers in touch with other engineers or tradesmen who had questions. That helped me see the cross-section of the engineering, design, and build process of such a large, interconnected project like a submarine.

        <h3>Structural Welder, General Dynamics Electric Boat</h3>
        <p class="date">2 years</p>
        <p>
          As a welder, I was on the factory floor watching VIRGINIA and COLUMBIA class submarines being put together. I was trained in welding, but also in OSHA safety regulations, and my job by necessity put me in close proximity to shipfitters and NDT weld inspectors. I learned about the effects of heat distortion on welded structures, and developed my own methods and fixtures to prevent it. I learned how to read structural drawings and derive the dimensions I need from the specified dimensions. I also was given the opportunity to assist the inspectors with magnetic particle testing of welds. My supervisor gave me agency when it came to strategizing large welding jobs, and I developed processes that would allow more welds to be done in the easier flat or horizontal positions, rather than the more difficult vertical or overhead positions. This helped save on time and cost as it would mean a lower chance for weld defects that would have to be corrected.
